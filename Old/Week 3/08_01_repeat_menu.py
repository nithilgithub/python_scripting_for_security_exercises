# Write an explicit infinite loop
# inside the infinite loop, read integer from user as an option

# If the option is 1: print here is your first step
# If the option is 2: print "you have some steps to go"
# If the option is 3: print "you are almost done"
# If the option is 4: quit from the loop

# If the option is other number: print it is an  invalid option
